# JATE Text Editor [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)]

  ## Description

  The Just Another Text Editor (JATE) is a PWA text editor with JavaScript syntax highlighting. As JATE is a PWA, it can be used on the browser or installed to one's device to be used without internect connection. 

  The JATE has been converted into a PWA, and before operated as a regular web application. As JATE is now a PWA, it has offline functionality, has better performance, and can be downloaded to a user's device. 

  Upon directing yourself to the [deployed link](), a user should be greeted by this window: ![browser-screenshot](./assets/screenshots/browser-screenshot.png)

  After downloading, JATE should look like this: ![installed=screenshot](./assets/screenshots/installed-screenshot.png)
